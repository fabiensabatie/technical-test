# Mexty Technical Test - Interactive Block

Welcome to the Mexty technical test! Your mission is to create an **interactive, customizable experience** as a reusable block.
See examples on [Mexty's marketplace](https://workspace.mexty.ai/marketplace)

## üéØ Objective

Create an engaging, interactive experience that can be **customized through props** and works on a specific topic of your choice.

### Requirements

‚úÖ **Must have:**
- An interactive experience that users can engage with
- **Props support** - the experience must be customizable via props (difficulty, theme, settings, etc.)
- Use **@mexty/realtime** for multiplayer/realtime features (already included in dependencies)
- Work on a specific topic (education, entertainment, productivity, etc.)
- Be creative and show your skills!

‚ùå **Forbidden:**
- Quiz/QCM formats
- Crossword puzzles
- Any basic question-answer systems

### Ideas to Inspire You

Think beyond traditional educational formats! Here are some directions:

- **Collaborative Drawing/Art** - Create together in real-time (customizable: canvas size, brush types, themes)
- **Memory/Matching Games** - Find pairs, sequences (customizable: difficulty, card types, themes)
- **Escape Room Puzzles** - Logic puzzles, pattern matching (customizable: puzzle type, difficulty)
- **Interactive Storytelling** - Branching narratives (customizable: story theme, choices)
- **Music/Rhythm Experiences** - Create or play music together (customizable: instruments, tempo)
- **Strategy Games** - Chess variants, board games (customizable: rules, board size)
- **Simulation Experiences** - Physics, chemistry, biology simulations (customizable: parameters)
- **Word Games** - Hangman variants, word associations (customizable: word lists, difficulty)
- **3D Experiences** - Like the included example! (customizable: model, animations, camera)

**Be creative!** The best submissions show technical skills AND innovative thinking.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens Vite development server at `http://localhost:5173` with hot reload.

**This is where you build your block!** Edit `src/block.tsx` and `src/App.tsx`.

### 3. Build Your Module

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates the production webpack bundle with Module Federation in the `dist/` folder.

### 4. Test Your Built Module

```bash
npm run test
```

Opens test playground at `http://localhost:3002` where you can:
- ‚úÖ Load your built webpack federation module
- ‚úÖ Test props customization in real-time
- ‚úÖ Verify everything works as expected

**Important:** Always run `npm run build` before `npm run test` to test the latest version!

## üìù What to Submit

1. Your completed code in the `src/` folder
2. A brief description of your experience in this README (add it below)
3. Example props that showcase different configurations
4. Make sure `npm run build` && `npm run test` works!

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx     # Entry point for development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx       # Exports the mount function for Module Federation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ block.tsx     # Your main Block component (customize this!)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css    # Your styles
```

## üìö Available Libraries

Already included in this project:
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **@mexty/realtime** - For multiplayer/realtime features
- **@react-three/fiber** & **@react-three/drei** - For 3D experiences
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics
- **Zustand** - State management
- **Tailwind CSS** - Via CDN (see index.html)

Need more? Add them to `package.json`!

## üí° Props System

Your block receives props through the `BlockProps` interface. Example:

```typescript
interface BlockProps {
  // Define your customizable properties here!
  difficulty?: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  theme?: string;
  playerCount?: number;
  // ... whatever makes sense for YOUR experience
}
```

These props can be changed in real-time in the test playground!

## üé® My Implementation: Advanced Collaborative Drawing Canvas

I've created a **high-performance real-time collaborative drawing application** that allows multiple users to draw together on a shared canvas with advanced optimization and smooth user experience.

### ‚ú® Features

**üé® Advanced Drawing Experience:**

- **Real-time collaborative drawing** with multiple users
- **Smooth quadratic curve rendering** for natural brush strokes
- **Dynamic brush and eraser tools** with live preview cursors
- **10 preset colors** (Black, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, Orange, Purple, Pink)
- **Adjustable brush size** (1-20px) with visual feedback
- **Intelligent stroke optimization** with distance-based point sampling
- **Canvas clearing** with instant synchronization

**üöÄ Performance Optimizations:**

- **60FPS rendering** with frame-rate throttling
- **Offscreen canvas support** for improved performance
- **Stroke batching and grouping** by color/size for efficient rendering
- **Smart stroke pruning** when approaching limits (removes 10% oldest strokes)
- **Throttled cursor updates** (30fps drawing, 10fps idle)
- **Efficient re-rendering** only when canvas is dirty

**üë• Advanced Multiplayer Features:**

- **Live cursor tracking** with user identification (shows last 4 chars of user ID)
- **Real-time stroke synchronization** using @mexty/realtime

The application demonstrates advanced React optimization techniques, sophisticated canvas rendering, and seamless real-time collaboration capabilities.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Guideline

This test is designed to take **2-4 hours**. Focus on:
1. ‚ú® Core interactive experience (60% of time)
2. üéõÔ∏è Props customization (20% of time)
3. üíÖ Polish and UX (20% of time)

**Quality over quantity!** A well-executed simple experience is better than a complex but buggy one.

Good luck and have fun! üöÄ
